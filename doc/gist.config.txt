*gist.config.txt*  CreateGist configuration

DESCRIPTION
    The `:CreateGist` command can be configured to avoid prompting the user for the privacy settings of the Gist and target clipboard.
    This is done by setting the `gist_clipboard` and `gist_privacy` variables in your `init.vim` file.

OPTIONS
    None

EXAMPLES
    `g:gist_clipboard = '0'` will set the clipboard to `no` by default.
    `g:gist_is_private = true` will set the privacy to `secret` by default.
